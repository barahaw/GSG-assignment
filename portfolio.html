                            A simple C++ console-based To-Do List application that uses a doubly linked list to manage
                            tasks
                            efficiently. This project provides functionalities to add tasks, delete tasks, mark tasks as
                            completed, reorder completed tasks to the front, and count incomplete tasks. It serves as an
                            excellent learning tool for understanding linked list operations and basic task management.
